"I don't know where it goes. So far user authentication is SpringBoot" - old description.

On 1-Apr-2020, I decided to learn springframework. That's one of my first repository where I tested core functionalities of every web application written in springboot.
It was inspiered by various online tutorials.

Starting from 28-Jan-2022, I forked my old playground repository with plan to
- add new functionalities
- collect aquired knowledge over course of last year and a half in one place 
- learn yet unfamiliar to me aspects of springboot
